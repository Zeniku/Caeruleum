Adds a few things

## Building 

Install JDK 17 or higher.

Mindustry Java mods are cross-platform, supporting PC (Windows, Mac, Linux) and Android. This section describes how to build the JARs for both PC and Android. Building these JARs are done through the usage of terminals: `cmd.exe` in Windows, Terminal in Mac, and if you're either on Linux or using a terminal emulator on Android such as Termux, you should already know what you're doing anyway. Following these steps should require basic terminal functionality such as `cd`.

### Desktop Build

Desktop builds are convenient for testing, but will obviously **not** work on Android, so never include this in your releases. Desktop JARs have `Desktop` suffixed to their name, e.g. `ModTemplateDesktop.jar`. Here's how you can build the mod:
1. Open your terminal, and `cd` to your local copy of the mod.
2. Ensure your internet connection on first or clean builds, as the project will try to fetch prerequisites from the internet.
3. Run `gradlew jar` *(replace `gradlew` with `./gradlew` on Mac/Linux)*. This should create a JAR inside `build/libs/` that you can copy over to the Mindustry mods folder to install it.
4. You can also then run `gradlew install` to automatically install the mod JAR, or even `gradlew jar install` to do both compiling and installing at once.

### Android Build

Android builds are automated on the CI hosted by GitHub Actions, so you should be able to just push a commit and wait for the CI to provide your build. If you still want to build locally, though, follow these steps.

#### Installing Android SDK
1. Install [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio#command-line-tools-only), specifically the "**Command line tools only**" section. Download the tools that match your platform.
2. Unzip the Android SDK command line tools inside a folder; let's call it `AndroidSDK/` for now.
3. Inside this folder is a folder named `cmdline-tools/`. Put everything inside `cmdline-tools/` to a new folder named `latest/`, so that the folder structure looks like `AndroidSDK/cmdline-tools/latest/`.
4. Open your terminal, `cd` to the `latest/` folder.
5. Run `sdkmanager --install "platforms;android-35" "build-tools;35.0.0"`. These versions correspond to the `androidSdkVersion` and `androidBuildVersion` properties inside `gradle.properties`, which default to `35` and `35.0.0`, respectively.
6. Set environment variable `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` as the full path to the `AndroidSDK/` folder you created, and restart your terminal to update the environments.

#### Building
1. Open your terminal, and `cd` to your local copy of the mod.
2. Run `gradlew dex`. This should create a cross-platform JAR inside `build/libs/` that isn't suffixed with `Desktop` that you can copy over to the Mindustry mods folder to install it.
3. You can then copy the resulting artifact to your phone's Mindustry mods folder in its data
